# Smile-Maker
### Smile maker proposal
- Smile maker will display the joke on the opened screen where we get a new one when it is refreshed.
- If you need more jokes to see we have to login into the account on the authentication page.
-Smile maker can access the user to edit the jokes or add a new one.
- Restful apiâ€™s are used for serving the data
- Application is developed in python with flask framework using Mysql/SQLite as database.
